# Adaptive Weighted Epidemic Prediction System

## Overview

The Adaptive Weighted Epidemic Prediction System is a web-based platform designed to simulate, analyze, and visualize the spread of infectious diseases within a controlled environment. The system models individuals as nodes in a network and their interactions as weighted connections. Using probabilistic simulation and recurrence-based prediction, the platform helps organizations understand potential outbreaks and take preventive actions.

This project aims to provide a practical decision-support tool for environments such as colleges, hospitals, offices, and research laboratories.

## System Workflow

1. Add persons to the system with unique IDs  
2. Create connections between persons with assigned weights  
3. Run simulations by selecting:
   - Patient zero  
   - Infection probability  
   - Number of days  
4. View detailed simulation results  
5. Analyze risk and network centrality  
6. Visualize infection spread using animated graphs
